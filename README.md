# Decoder_Ring
I did a project at Thinkful's Software Engineering Bootcamp. While working on it, I practiced writing complex algorithms and doing tests with Mocha and Chai.

* The function caesar performs the Caesar shift cipher on a given input string. It shifts each alphabetic character by a specified amount (positive for encoding, negative for decoding) while maintaining the case. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged. The function also checks if the shift value is within a valid range and provides an option to encode or decode based on the 'encode' parameter. The resulting string is returned as the output

* This demonstration shows users how to encode and decode messages using Caser Shift and passing the unit test with Mocha and Chai
